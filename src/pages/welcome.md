Pixeebot will begin scanning your repos, and will provide feedback within minutes. You should expect feedback in the form of a pull request with hardening suggestions, or a comment on your latest commit letting you know that pixeebot was unable to find any opportunities to harden your code. But either way pixeebot will remain vigilant, and will help prevent vulnerabilities in the future. Pixeebot will periodically scan your default branch, and open PR's to harden your code. Pixeebot will also analyze your new pull requests and harden your code before it gets merged into the default branch.
