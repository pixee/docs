# Open Source

Pixee believes in open source. We leverage tools from the community and strive to contribute where there are gaps and where we can provide unique solutions.

## Codemodder

The fixes we make in Pixee are powered by our open source (and open format!) project called [Codemodder](https://codemodder.io) -- check it out!
