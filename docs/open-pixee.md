# Open Pixee

Pixee believes in open source. We leverage tools from the community and strive to contribute where there are gaps and where we can provide unique solutions.

Our product is best experienced via the [GitHub App pixeebot](https://github.com/marketplace/pixeebot-automated-code-fixes/). Powering this pixeebot product experience are several open source projects. See more below and then dig deeper in each project's README.

## Pixee CLI

The Pixee CLI brings the power of Pixee's [Codemodder framework](https://codemodder.io) to your local development environment. This provides a way for developers to try out Pixee before installing the GitHub app.
