# FAQs

### How does Pixee handle my data?
Pixee is a platform focused on helping developers deliver higher quality code and places the utmost importance on product security.  All data is encrypted in transit and at rest.   

## Alpha FAQs

### What can I expect from Alpha testing of pixeebot?
Alpha users will be paired with a Pixee employee for the session. Participants will complete a set of tasks with a functional product. The sessions will be recorded and participants will be asked a series of questions following their usage about their experience. The information gleaned will only be used for us to improve our product.

### What can I say about Pixee or pixeebot publicly?
Although we arenâ€™t asking participants to sign legal agreements, we ask that you keep Pixee confidential. We are in stealth and plan to make a big public splash in mid-2023.

### Will I be compensated?
There is no compensation or known risk associated with participating. We will try our best to get you some cool swag though. :wink:

### Will my information, i.e. code, projects, be used for anything following the test?
Each party agrees to hold data and confidential information of the other party in confidence and not to disclose, retain, or distribute such information to third parties or to use such information for any purpose whatsoever. You can also find a link to our Privacy Policy at the bottom of this page.

### What is the next step after the Alpha testing?
Feedback from the Alpha phase will be used to improve the product. We aim to act quick and will do our best to inform users of actions we take from the input they provided us. Alpha users will be kept in the loop to try the future iterations of pixeebot.

### Where can I learn more about pixeebot?
Users will receive an exclusive invitation to join the OpenPixee community on Slack. This will be one channel to engage with peers who are also interested in Pixee. Feel free to email us at feedback@pixee.ai with any questions.
