# FAQs

### What are Pixee's AI features?

We utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide context-aware code fixes and to add code-specific comments, helping developers understand why a change is being recommended.

### What is Pixee's AI policy?

At Pixee, we take your data privacy and security seriously. To ensure your trust, we have decided to use the [Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/data-privacy). We want you to have peace of mind, knowing that your data will never be used to train AI models.

By default, we enable the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for an enhanced user experience. However, if you prefer not to use them, you can easily [disable](configuring.md) this feature at your convenience. We believe in providing you with the flexibility to tailor your experience according to your preferences and needs.

### How does Pixee handle my data?

Pixee is a platform focused on helping developers deliver higher quality code and places the utmost importance on our own security, including secure software development practices, IT practices, corporate controls and partner assessments. In case anyone asks, yes -- all data is encrypted in transit and at rest, and guaranteed to be destroyed.

As an aside, many of us have been in security our whole careers, and we're quite passionate about it! We document all of this and more in our [Security and Trust Center](https://trust.pixee.ai/).

### How will my information (i.e. code, projects, etc.) be used?
