# FAQs

### What are Pixee's AI features?

We utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide context-aware code fixes and to add code-specific comments, helping developers understand why a change is being recommended.

### What is Pixee's AI policy?

At Pixee, we take your data privacy and security seriously. We want you to have peace of mind, knowing that your data will never be used to train AI models.

By default, we enable the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for an enhanced user experience. However, if you prefer not to use them, you can easily [disable](configuring.md) this feature at your convenience. We believe in providing you with the flexibility to tailor your experience according to your preferences and needs.

### How does Pixee handle my data?

Pixee is a platform focused on helping developers deliver higher quality code and places the utmost importance on our own security, including secure software development practices, IT practices, corporate controls and partner assessments. In case anyone asks, yes -- all data is encrypted in transit and at rest, and guaranteed to be destroyed.

As an aside, many of us have been in security our whole careers, and we're quite passionate about it! We document all of this and more in our [Security and Trust Center](https://trust.pixee.ai/).

### How will my information (i.e. code, projects, etc.) be used?

Each party agrees to hold data and confidential information of the other party in confidence and not to disclose, retain, or distribute such information to third parties or to use such information for any purpose whatsoever. Please take a look at our full [Privacy Policy](https://www.pixee.ai/privacy) for more detail.

### How do I know Pixeebot made changes?

Pixeebot works directly with your repositories in GitHub through pull requests, so you decide when and if you want to accept changes suggested by Pixeebot. You can find suggestions made by Pixeebot in the [Pixeebot Dashboard](https://app.pixee.ai/) as well as your repository's GitHub.com pull requests page. Also, Pixeebot [cryptographically signs every commit](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work), which means changes suggested by Pixeebot are guaranteed to have come from Pixeebot, were not modified after the fact and are [verified by GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification).

### Does Pixeebot work with CodeQL?

Yes! Pixeebot can help you address issues discovered by [CodeQL](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/introduction-to-code-scanning/about-code-scanning-with-codeql) and [GitHub Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security). For the best results, use the [GitHub provided action](https://github.com/github/codeql-action) to trigger CodeQL analysis against your default branch and Pixeebot will take it from there. If CodeQL discovers issues Pixeebot can fix, you'll see a pull request from Pixeebot with suggested changes to your code. Check out our [docs page](code-scanning-tools/codeql) for more information about the types of CodeQL findings Pixeebot can fix.
