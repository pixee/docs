# FAQs

### How does Pixee handle my data?
Pixee is a platform focused on helping developers deliver higher quality code and places the utmost importance on our own security, including secure software development practices, IT practices, corporate controls and partner assessments. In case anyone asks, yes -- all data is encrypted in transit and at rest, and guaranteed to be destroyed after some time.

As an aside, many of us have been in security our whole careers, and we're quite passionate about it! We document all of this and more on our Security and Trust center at https://trust.pixee.ai/.

### How will my information, i.e. code, projects, be used?
Each party agrees to hold data and confidential information of the other party in confidence and not to disclose, retain, or distribute such information to third parties or to use such information for any purpose whatsoever. You can also find a link to our Privacy Policy at the bottom of this page.
