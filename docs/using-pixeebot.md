# User Guide

Once installed, Pixeebot will begin opening pull requests against your repositories immediately. There is no need to summon Pixeebot manually -- all of your improvements will come automatically and at a manageable pace.

## Summoning Pixeebot

If you have merged all your Pixeebot pull requests, and you're eager to see more suggestions, you can summon Pixeebot manually. Simply reply to a pull request or open an issue with the following text:

`@pixeebot next`

This will let Pixeebot know it should immediately open a new pull request with additional improvements for this repository.

### Summoning Pixeebot via an issue

Open an issue with the summon command in the issue body:

![Summon from issue](/img/summon1.png)

Within a couple of minutes, Pixeebot will open a new pull request with additional improvements for your repository:

### Pull request updates 

If Pixeebot opens a pull request that remains open, additional updates will be made automatically over time. The first update will be a reminder from Pixeebot in the form of a pull request comment. If the pull request is not merged or closed after the first reminder comment, Pixeebot will eventually close the pull request with a final comment. If a closed pull request indicates additional suggestions are available, Pixeebot can still be summoned after the pull request has been reopened.
