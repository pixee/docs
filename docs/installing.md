# Installing

To install Pixeebot, visit our [GitHub App page](https://github.com/apps/pixeebot/). From there, click **Install** (or **Configure**) and follow the prompts from GitHub. You'll be directed to your Pixee dashboard once the installation process is complete.




## Repository access

During installation, youâ€™ll need to specify which of your repositories Pixeebot can access. This can be done in one of two ways: 

* **All repositories -** By selecting this option, Pixeebot will monitor all your existing and future repositories.
* **Select repositories -** Opting for this choice will present you with a list of your current repositories. From there, you can choose the specific repositories Pixeebot can access.
