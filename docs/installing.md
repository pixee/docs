# Installing

Pixee is available as a GitHub App on the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/apps/pixeebot/).
We provide a free tier offering that can be installed on any public or private repository. This is a great way to get started with Pixee and see how it can help to harden and secure your code.

To try Pixee, visit our [GitHub App page](https://github.com/apps/pixeebot/). From there, click **Install** (or **Configure**) and follow the prompts from GitHub. You'll be directed to your Pixee dashboard once the installation process is complete.

See the [Preferences](/configuring) page for information on how to configure Pixee to suit your needs.

## Pixee Enterprise Server

Pixee can be deployed on-premises for organizations that require additional security or compliance measures. To learn more about Pixee on-premises solutions, please [contact us](https://pixee.ai/demo-landing-page).

Also [contact us](https://pixee.ai/demo-landing-page) if you want to partner as early customers for other SCMs, including GitLab, Bitbucket, or ADO.

## Tool Connections

Pixee can provide fixes "out of the box" for Java and Python repositories. But you'll get the most value out of Pixee by [connecting it to your existing code scanning tools and services](/code-scanning-tools/overview). This will allow Pixee to provide more accurate and relevant fixes for your codebase.

## Repository access

During installation, youâ€™ll need to specify which of your repositories Pixee can access. This can be done in one of two ways:

- **All repositories -** By selecting this option, Pixee will monitor all your existing and future repositories.
- **Select repositories -** Opting for this choice will present you with a list of your current repositories. From there, you can choose the specific repositories Pixee can access.

## Updating repository access

To update repository access for Pixee:

**From Pixee Dashboard:**

- Click the "+Add installation" link at the bottom of your Installations page.

**From GitHub:**

- Go to your GitHub homepage.
- Navigate to Settings > Integrations > Applications.
- Select "pixeebot" from the list of applications.
- Click the configure button to access Pixee settings.

Repository access selection can be managed at any time by adjusting settings through either of these paths.
