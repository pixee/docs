# Language support

Pixee has evolved to a language-agnostic platform that can triage and fix security issues across most critical programming languages. Our agentic capabilities are designed to understand and work with diverse codebases, regardless of the underlying language or framework.

## Currently supported languages

When triaging and fixing issues detected by code scanning tools, Pixee provides robust support for:

### Programming Languages

- Java
- Python
- C#/.NET
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Node.js
- Ruby
- Go
- PHP
- Kotlin
- Rust
- Scala
- Swift
- Objective-C

### Infrastructure as Code

- Terraform/HCL
- Dockerfile/Containerfile
- Kubernetes/Helm
- CloudFormation
- Ansible
- Docker Compose

## Expanding language coverage

Our language-agnostic architecture means we're continuously expanding support to cover more languages and frameworks. If you're working with a language not explicitly listed here, Pixee may still be able to help with security issue triage and remediation.

For questions about specific language support or to request coverage for additional languages, please [contact us](https://pixee.ai/demo-landing-page).
