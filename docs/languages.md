# Language support

Pixee can fix issues in Java and Python repositories "out of the box" without a code scanner integration. But, you'll get the most value out of Pixee by connecting it to your existing code scanning tools. This will allow Pixee to provide more accurate and relevant fixes for your codebase and to triage findings from those tools.

When triaging and fixing issues detected by code scanning tools, Pixee supports the following languages:

- Java
- Python
- C#/.NET
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Node.js

We are continuously working on expanding our language support. If you need support for a language not listed here, please [contact us](https://pixee.ai/demo-landing-page).
