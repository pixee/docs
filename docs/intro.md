# Introducing Pixeebot üëã

Pixeebot is your automated product security engineer.

Pixeebot triages and fixes issues detected by your [code scanning tools](/code-scanning-tools/overview). It hardens and improves your code in the form of pull requests.

Pixeebot is powered by the open-source [codemodder framework](https://codemodder.io/). These codemods power Pixeebot‚Äôs fixes, and are continuously updated to ensure Pixeebot‚Äôs recommendations align with industry standards and best practices.

### How does Pixeebot help me?

1. üóÉÔ∏è **Continuous Improvement:** works down your backlog of issues and keeps your codebase secure.
2. :seedling: **PR Improvement:** checks each new pull request (PR) and recommends improvements.
3. üîé **Triage**: identifies false positives and prioritizes issues that need fixing.

### What types of issues can Pixeebot triage and fix?

Pixeebot can triage and fix a wide range of security issues detected by code scanning tools. Many of these issues are common across tools and languages, such as:

- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Insecure Deserialization
- Insecure Randomness
- Unsafe XML Parsing
- Insecure Cookie Handling
- Command Injection
- Insecure Configuration

### How can I test Pixeebot?

Pixeebot is available as a GitHub App on the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/apps/pixeebot/). We provide a free tier offering that can be installed on any public or private repository. This is a great way to get started with Pixeebot and see how it can help to harden and secure your code.

If you need a repository to test with, we recommend trying Pixeebot out with a deliberately insecure application. Template repositories containing Java and Python test applications are available in PixeeSandbox: [https://github.com/PixeeSandbox](https://github.com/PixeeSandbox)

Testing with these deliberately insecure applications can give you an idea of how Pixeebot works, before installing it directly on your personal or professional repositories.

For additional details, see the [Installation](/installing) page.

Pixeebot also supports on-premises deployment for organizations that require additional security or compliance measures. To learn more about Pixeebot on-premises solutions, please [contact us](https://pixee.ai/demo-landing-page).

### What environment & languages does Pixeebot support?

Pixeebot supports a wide variety of languages and code scanning tools. For a full list of supported languages, tools, and rules, see the [Code Scanning Tools](/code-scanning-tools/overview) page.
