# Introducing Pixeebot üßö‚Äçü§ñÔ∏è

Pixeebot is a [GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/pixeebot/) that automatically improves your code as if it were another developer on your team.

It's powered by an open source toolkit called [codemodder](https://codemodder.io/). 

### How does Pixeebot help me?
Pixeebot operates continuously in the background for the repositories you have installed the app on. It will immediately start helping in two modes:
1. :on: **Continuous Improvement:** monitor your default branch for improvements that can be made and occasionally send you Pull Requests.
2. :seedling: **PR Improvement:** check each new Pull Request for improvement opportunities.

We suggest improvements for your code's security, performance, and quality.

### What environment & languages does Pixeebot support?
Pixeebot is currently limited to Java repositories on GitHub. Additional languages are coming soon!

### What does Pixeebot cost?
Pixeebot is currently and will probably forever be free for all users.
