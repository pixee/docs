# CodeQL

Pixee can automatically fix and triage issues detected by [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/).

# GitHub Advanced Security

No setup is required for GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) users to receive fixes from CodeQL results that are uploaded as Code Scanning alerts. Triage for GHAS is best experienced through [our dashboard](https://app.pixee.ai).
