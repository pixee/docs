# Codemods

Pixeebot applies codemods to help strengthen and secure your code. This section gives detailed information on available codemods by programming language, including how they change the code, how you should consider reviewing their output, and more. First, note that codemods fall into two categories: **Core**, and **Pro**.


## What are Core Codemods? 

Core Codemods are maintained as part of the open source [codemodder project](https://codemodder.io/). These codemods are executed by Pixeebot to make security and performance improvements to [Java](https://github.com/pixee/codemodder-java/) and [Python](https://github.com/pixee/codemodder-python/) repositories. 

Core Codemods are available for Free, Pro, and Enterprise Pixee plans. See plan and pricing details [here](https://www.pixee.ai/pricing). 

## What are Pro Codemods? 

Pro Codemods are executed by Pixeebot to make security and performance improvements to JavaScript and .NET repositories. Pro Codemods are closed-source and require an **Enterprise** plan. See plan and pricing details [here](https://www.pixee.ai/pricing).
