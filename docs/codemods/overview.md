# Core Codemods

Pixeebot currently applies all of the Pixee core codemods [for Java](https://github.com/pixee/codemodder-java/tree/main/core-codemods/src/main/java/io/codemodder/codemods), which are maintained as part of the [codemodder project](https://codemodder.io/) to help strengthen your code.

This section gives detailed information on those codemods, including how they change the code, how you should consider reviewing their output, and more.
