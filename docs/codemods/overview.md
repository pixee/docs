# Core Codemods

Pixeebot currently applies all of the Pixee core codemods for [Java](https://github.com/pixee/codemodder-java/) and [Python](https://github.com/pixee/codemodder-python/), which are maintained as part of the [codemodder project](https://codemodder.io/) to help strengthen your code. More languages are coming soon!

This section gives detailed information on those codemods, including how they change the code, how you should consider reviewing their output, and more.
